        <p class="lead">
          With the last press of the button, you hold your breath, bracing for an explosion. The station’s red alert klaxons wail in the background. Seconds stretch into hours—then, at last, the device powers down. A wave of relief floods over you.
        </p>

        <p>
          You slap your communicator, calling for a direct link to the station commander. Before long you are seated in a ready room opposite the head of the Tandaran fleet—a strangely familiar man. The silence is heavy as he studies the PADD in his hands, reviewing the evidence. Finally, he closes it and fixes you with a level gaze.
        </p>

        <p>
          You recount the case from the beginning: every clue, every alibi, even the details some would rather forget. When you finish with Taldare’s death and the bomb plot, the Tandaran envoy exhales slowly, as if weighing the cost of every word.
        </p>

        <p class="mono">
          “A mere few hours ago, we were ready to launch a war against the Federation. Now we learn it would have been under false pretenses—and worse, that we would have walked into a trap. That war would have spilled the blood of thousands, perhaps millions.
        </p>
        <p class="mono">
          Vorek was my brother. We shared blood, but not ideals. Regretful as it is, I have no doubt he would have carried out the very scheme you uncovered. Our people have lived in isolation and paranoia for too long. I sought an alliance, and I still believe one is possible.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Rising, he extends his hand.
        </p>

        <p class="mono">
          “As acting commander of the Tandaran fleet, I, Yul Thalen, will gladly participate in negotiations with the Federation.”
        </p>

        <p>
          A brief smile crosses his face. “One special request, though—perhaps you can secure me access to this… <em>Two Klingons, One Bat’leth</em> holoprogram?”
        </p>

        <p>
          Weeks later, life aboard the station has returned to a kind of normal. In your quarters, a new award sits proudly on the shelf: a certificate commemorating your actions.
        </p>

        <p class="final">
          A killer was caught.<br/>
          An attack was stopped.<br/>
          A war was prevented.
        </p>
