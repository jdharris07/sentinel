My primary functions aboard this station include coordinating critical systems, monitoring compliance with Starfleet protocols, and providing operational support to personnel… and occasionally reminding the Captain to hydrate.

I will assist you in your investigation to the best of my capacity, though based on available evidence and your apparent experience level, I calculate only a 14.7% probability that you will solve this case. Please do not take this personally — statistics are indifferent.

That said, low odds are still odds. Ask, and I will provide what information I can, but pleas enote my responses may be limited as the station is preparing for the Tandaran fleet's arrival.</div>
